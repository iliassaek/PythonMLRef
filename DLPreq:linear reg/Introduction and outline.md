# Introduction and Outline

## What is ML ?
* Try to predict out come from  past examples 
    * stock market
    * disease
    * Tomorrow's weather

### categories 
* Supervised 
    * Output is given (x,y)
* Unsupervised 
    *no output just trying to learn structure (X)

### Supervised Learning
* Classification 
    * trying to predict a category or label
        * What digit is this ?
        * Does the picture contains a cat ?
* Regression 
    * predicting a real-valued number or vector 
        * Temperature
        * GOOG stock price

## Linear Regression
* Known as "Line of best fit"
* Supervised (X -> Y)
* regression out put is a number 

### Real world example 
* X = #hours of exercices in a week -> Y =body mass index
* X = #Hours of studying -> Y = grade

### Be careful
* While determining the direction of causality 
* It's  pretty obvious that the more you train the more your BMI will be healthier
* The only thing you can conclude though when you find  a line of best fit and it fits very well the data , is that the two variables are correlated with each other . But doesn't mean that one causes the other .
